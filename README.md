Stability_of_Kmeans
===================

We consider various similarity measures between different clusterings of a dataset, parametrized by the number of clusters.  Parallelizing our code, we graph the similiarity between 20 implementations of kmeans for 1 up to 15 clusters.  Studying these histograms, we can make a better choice about how many clusters best segregates out linguisitic dataset.
